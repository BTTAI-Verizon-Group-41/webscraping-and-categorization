unpkg.com,"UNPKG UNPKG unpkg is a fast, global content delivery network for everything on npm . Use it to quickly and easily load any file from any package using a URL like: unpkg.com/:package@:version/:file Examples Using a fixed version: unpkg.com/react@16.7.0/umd/react.production.min.js unpkg.com/react-dom@16.7.0/umd/react-dom.production.min.js You may also use a semver range or a tag instead of a fixed version number, or omit the version/tag entirely to use the latest tag. unpkg.com/react@^16/umd/react.production.min.js unpkg.com/react/umd/react.production.min.js If you omit the file path (i.e. use a “bare” URL), unpkg will serve the file specified by the unpkg field in package.json , or fall back to main . unpkg.com/jquery unpkg.com/three Append a / at the end of a URL to view a listing of all the files in a package. unpkg.com/react/ unpkg.com/react-router/ Query Parameters ?meta Return metadata about any file in a package as JSON (e.g. /any/file?meta ) ?module Expands all “bare” import specifiers in  modules to unpkg URLs. This feature is very experimental Cache Behavior The CDN caches files based on their permanent URL, which includes the npm package version. This works because npm does not allow package authors to overwrite a package that has already been published with a different one at the same version number. Browsers are instructed (via the Cache-Control header) to cache assets indefinitely (1 year). URLs that do not specify a package version number redirect to one that does. This is the latest version when no version is specified, or the maxSatisfying version when a semver version is given. Redirects are cached for 10 minutes at the CDN, 1 minute in browsers. If you want users to be able to use the latest version when you cut a new release, the best policy is to put the version number in the URL directly in your installation instructions. This will also load more quickly because we won't have to resolve the latest version and redirect them. Workflow For npm package authors, unpkg relieves the burden of publishing your code to a CDN in addition to the npm registry. All you need to do is include your UMD build in your npm package (not your repo, that's different!). You can do this easily using the following setup: Add the umd (or dist ) directory to your .gitignore file Add the umd directory to your files array in package.json Use a build script to generate your UMD build in the umd directory when you publish That's it! Now when you npm publish you'll have a version available on unpkg as well. About unpkg is an open source project built and maintained by Michael Jackson . unpkg is not affiliated with or supported by npm, Inc. in any way. Please do not contact npm for help with unpkg. Instead, please reach out to @unpkg with any questions or concerns. The unpkg CDN is powered by Cloudflare , one of the world's largest and fastest cloud network platforms. The origin server runs on auto-scaling infrastructure provided by Fly.io . The app servers run in 17 cities around the world, and come and go based on active requests."

Buying Smart Security Systems: Top Considerations Home security systems and smart technology are a great combination for minimizing risk and maximizing peace of mind. The best smart security systems see exactly what you need, when you need it. With Alarm.com, we’ve thought of everything. Residential Security Systems Check in on your home while on vacation or working long days. Enjoy peace of mind with intrusion detection, video doorbell cameras, outdoor cameras with two-way voice, and HD night-vision cameras supported by video analytics technology. These are the features you need at a minimum. Older security monitoring systems tend to be outdated and difficult to manage. Invest in smart automation and a home security system that connects directly to your smartphone and make last-minute adjustments to your system set-up from anywhere. When it comes to security, time is of the essence. Monitored security systems are essential for quick response times. During an alarm event, professionals will confirm the threat and immediately alert the authorities. Trust Alarm.com to keep you connected with a fully monitored and integrated smart home system that protects your home and family for the long-haul. Small Business and Commercial Security Systems Commercial businesses and retail stores face different security threats compared to residential buildings, like petty theft or shoplifting. For this reason, you need a different approach. An automatic arming system eliminates human error and is a must-have feature for any business serious about its security. Prevent inside jobs with careful access control, so you know who can access your firm outside of business hours. Finally, ensure you opt for a solution tailored to your industry. The needs of the food and beverage industry differ from those of a construction business. Always choose the security alarm company that can meet the common needs of your industry.

Our licensed security providers configure your security solution based on several variables, including: Area/Property Type – Where do you live? Every neighborhood has a crime risk, but some areas are at a higher risk than others. Property Details – Where do you live? Do you own a home or do you live in an apartment that needs approval before installation? Type of Crime – Is commercial theft a big issue in your part of town? Do criminals like to steal expensive machinery where you live? Our security providers take that into account.

Securing your home doesn't have to be complicated. We believe in security made simple. With Alarm.com, it's easy to customize a system that meets your unique needs. Choose Alarm.com to protect what matters most. How is Alarm.com Different? Alarm.com is engineered to be more reliable than other systems. Unlike other systems that share a phone or cable line, Alarm.com systems use a dedicated, secure cellular connection to provide reliable and uninterrupted service for your critical security messages. This also means that there is no physical phone or cable line exposed on the outside of your house that could be cut and compromise your system. Your system will communicate even if the power is out, or the Internet or broadband is down. If your panel is tampered with or destroyed, Alarm.com still sends a signal to the authorities, thanks to Crash & Smash Protection. Proactive safeguards do more to help you stay safe. If there’s an emergency, we’re Alarm.com puts you one step ahead. If smoke or carbon monoxide is detected, Alarm.com can automatically shut down the heat or AC to stop the circulation of dangerous fumes, and send a signal to emergency personnel. Your system’s cameras can even sound an alert to deter unwanted visitors when you’re not home. How? Alarm.com lets you easily set rules so that your home automatically responds in an emergency to help keep you safe. Alarm.com connect your home’s key devices—like carbon monoxide, smoke detectors, cameras, and your heating and AC system—wirelessly to the security panel. Alerts and notifications work for you 24/7 – even when your system is disarmed. Alarm.com’s always-on technology keeps you notified of any activity you care about, whether your system is armed or not. This means you can get text, push, or email notifications when a door or window is opened or, if a medicine cabinet is opened. With flexible and easy to set custom rules and alerts, you can get reminders if the garage door hasn’t been closed by 10pm, or if you leave home without arming the system. Create reminders based on time of day, or when the system detects that you’ve left home. Customizable solutions grow with you over time.

My family is from Cuba, and they were Cuban immigrants, but I was born in the U.S. And it was a household filled with music. There are so many beautiful Cuban songs that my mother would be singing. It was just a lovely growing-up time. :30-:48 [A woman stands in her home, holding sheet music, singing in Spanish. We then hear her speaking over the music.] MYRA: I'm Myra Solano Garcia… :49-:51 [Myra is speaking to the camera, with colorful windows in the background.] MYRA: … and I am living with Alzheimer’s disease. :52-1:03 [Classical piano music plays in the background as a photo of Myra singing on stage appears.] MYRA: For so many people, they're so afraid of being on stage. But for me, it has always been so natural. I had opportunities … 1:04-1:11 [The music continues, and the video cuts to Myra speaking to the camera. A title appears with Myra Solano Garcia, Living with Alzheimer’s.] MYRA: … to travel across the country and just enjoy the power of music. 1:12-1:41 [A man sitting at a piano speaks to the camera. A title appears with Shawn Kirchner, Composer, Songwriter and Publisher. The video shows Myra singing a duet at church as he speaks.] SHAWN: Myra had a really big career back east as a soloist. So when she first arrived, we were so excited, and we worked with her a lot as a featured soloist. But more recently, I remember one choir practice thinking the question she's asking, describing the page number, the measure number, is just not computing. And it didn't make any sense to me. Once we had the diagnosis of Alzheimer's, then I'm like, oh, my gosh. But I mean, all things withstanding, it's just fantastic that we're able to work with her and that she's contributing so much. 1:42-2:13 [Myra sits at a table in her living room, looking through old photos. We see photos fade in and out on screen as she speaks.] MYRA: This photo is from when I was just hired at the University of LaVerne as a vice president. I looked a lot younger then. I wonder why? The first two years, I felt were very strong years. It was about the third year when things started not feeling right, and I went to different neurologists and they would say, “No, you're fine. You have ADD.” 2:14-2:21 [Myra is speaking to the camera.] MYRA: And to be honest, I was thrilled, because I really feared that it was going to be Alzheimer's disease. 2:22-2:39 [More photos of Myra.] MYRA: When I finally got the Alzheimer's diagnosis, I was relieved because I knew that I was still having cognitive problems. A neuropsychiatrist encouraged me to enter a clinical trial, and I'm so very grateful. 2:40-3:03 [Myra is in her home singing “Someone to Watch Over Me.” We see photos of Myra and her husband. We then see Myra driving in the car and running in her neighborhood.] MYRA: (speaking) My husband takes great care of me. We have a lot of fun on the weekends. We get in the car, and we just go traveling throughout California. Not too long ago, we did a 5K race. I came in second place in my age group. 3:04-3:16 [Myra is speaking to the camera.] MYRA: While I have Alzheimer's disease, I can no longer do numbers. I have difficulty with names, but I can still sing. 3:17-3:51 [We hear Myra singing “Amazing Grace” while the camera shows an exterior shot of a continuing care center near her home. We then see Myra singing to a person in the memory unit at the center and continuing to sing “Amazing Grace.”] MYRA: I volunteer at a continuing care organization, singing with the memory unit residents, and I am fully cognizant that I'm going to be following in their paths. But in the meantime, it just brings me joy. You can see that they're confused, but we start singing, and so many of them know all the words. I think that that is the power of music. 3:52-4:03 [Shawn is speaking to the camera. We then see shots of Myra smiling while volunteering in the memory care unit.] SHAWN: Music, they say lights up so many areas of the brain, and so it makes total sense that Myra feels at home, despite whatever is going on with her diagnosis. Music is with us to the end. 4:04-4:33 [A choir sings as the camera shows the exterior of a church. The video shows Myra singing as part of her church choir.] MYRA: I'm so grateful I found a church community that really sings to my soul. I love singing and I love bringing music to others. We're all going to go at some point in time. And if I go via Alzheimer's disease, it is what it is. 4:34-4:47 [The video shows Myra looking at old photos, driving, pulling trash cans into her garage, reading while sitting on her couch, and then shows her again speaking to the camera.] MYRA: Because I can still do things that are important to me … I can drive, I can take care of the house. I can read. I'm going to focus on those, and I'm not going to focus on the things that I can't do. So I'm not afraid. 4:48-4:50 [Myra is on her back porch, looking to the sky, with her garden in the background.] MYRA: I'm just living life. And loving life. 4:51-4:55 [Music fades out in the background.] [The Red Lilly logo appears and fades on a white background.] Another Way to Get Select Lilly Medicines You’re juggling a lot, especially when it comes to your health.

Personal Loan Terms Fixed rates from 8.99% APR to 29.49% APR reflect the 0.25% autopay interest rate discount and a 0.25% direct deposit interest rate discount. SoFi rate ranges are current as of 11/28/24 and are subject to change without notice. The average of SoFi Personal Loans funded in 2022 was around $30K. Not all applicants qualify for the lowest rate. Lowest rates reserved for the most creditworthy borrowers. Your actual rate will be within the range of rates listed and will depend on the term you select, evaluation of your creditworthiness, income, and a variety of other factors. Loan amounts range from $5,000– $100,000. The APR is the cost of credit as a yearly rate and reflects both your interest rate and an origination fee of 0%-7%, which will be deducted from any loan proceeds you receive. PERSONAL LOAN INTEREST RATES AND FEES | ELIGIBILITY AND IMPORTANT DETAILS. Annual percentage rates (APRs) shown include the 0.25% autopay discount. If approved for a loan, the rates and terms offered will depend on things like creditworthiness, the length of the loan, and other factors, and will fall within the range of rates available by applicable loan term; check out our full APR examples and terms. Remember, not all applicants will qualify for the lowest rate. Want to learn more? See our eligibility criteria at SoFi.com/eligibility-criteria. SoFi reserves the right to change interest rates at any time without notice, changes would only apply to applications begun after the effective date of the change. Fixed Rates: Fixed rates range from 8.99% APR to 29.49% APR (with autopay). The SoFi 0.25% autopay interest rate reduction requires you to agree to make your scheduled monthly payments by an automatic monthly deduction (ACH) from a savings or checking account. Enrolling in autopay is not required to receive a loan from SoFi. Loan Terms: SoFi Personal Loans offer loans with a period of repayment between 2 and 7-year terms. Loan Fees: SoFi personal loans have no fees required; specifically, no origination fees required, no late fees, no prepayment penalties. PERSONAL LOAN | REPAYMENT EXAMPLE. The following example depicts the APR, monthly payment and total payments during the life of a $30,000 personal loan with a 2-year repayment term, a 0.25% autopay discount, and a fixed rate between 8.99% APR to 29.49% APR. It works out to 24 monthly payments ranging from $1,356.68–$1,529.07 for a total amount of payments ranging from $32,560.37–$36,697.76. This repayment example assumes that the borrower is signed up for autopay and that all payments are made on time, with no pre-payments. Actual rates may vary based on repayment term, loan amount, creditworthiness, and other terms and conditions. SoFi does not offer variable rate personal loans. State restrictions may apply.

Investment Products: ARE NOT FDIC INSURED • ARE NOT BANK GUARANTEED • MAY LOSE VALUE Rule 606 Order Routing ^ SoFi members with direct deposit activity can earn 4.20% annual percentage yield (APY) on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% APY on checking balances. Direct Deposit means a recurring deposit of regular income to an account holder’s SoFi Checking or Savings account, including payroll, pension, or government benefit payments (e.g., Social Security), made by the account holder’s employer, payroll or benefits provider or government agency (“Direct Deposit”) via the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) Network during a 30-day Evaluation Period (as defined below). Deposits that are not from an employer or government agency, including but not limited to check deposits, peer-to-peer transfers (e.g., transfers from PayPal, Venmo, etc.), merchant transactions (e.g., transactions from PayPal, Stripe, Square, etc.), and bank ACH funds transfers and wire transfers from external accounts, or are non-recurring in nature (e.g., IRS tax refunds), do not constitute Direct Deposit activity. There is no minimum Direct Deposit amount required to qualify for the stated interest rate. SoFi members with direct deposit are eligible for other SoFi Plus benefits. As an alternative to direct deposit, SoFi members with Qualifying Deposits can earn 4.20% APY on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% APY on checking balances. Qualifying Deposits means one or more deposits that, in the aggregate, are equal to or greater than $5,000 to an account holder’s SoFi Checking and Savings account (“Qualifying Deposits”) during a 30-day Evaluation Period (as defined below). Qualifying Deposits only include those deposits from the following eligible sources: (i) ACH transfers, (ii) inbound wire transfers, (iii) peer-to-peer transfers (i.e., external transfers from PayPal, Venmo, etc. and internal peer-to-peer transfers from a SoFi account belonging to another account holder), (iv) check deposits, (v) instant funding to your SoFi Bank Debit Card, (vi) push payments to your SoFi Bank Debit Card, and (vii) cash deposits. Qualifying Deposits do not include: (i) transfers between an account holder’s Checking account, Savings account, and/or Vaults; (ii) interest payments; (iii) bonuses issued by SoFi Bank or its affiliates; or (iv) credits, reversals, and refunds from SoFi Bank, N.A. (“SoFi Bank”) or from a merchant.
SoFi members with Qualifying Deposits are not eligible for other SoFi Plus benefits. SoFi Bank shall, in its sole discretion, assess each account holder’s Direct Deposit activity and Qualifying Deposits throughout each 30-Day Evaluation Period to determine the applicability of rates and may request additional documentation for verification of eligibility. The 30-Day Evaluation Period refers to the “Start Date” and “End Date” set forth on the APY Details page of your account, which comprises a period of 30 calendar days (the “30-Day Evaluation Period”). You can access the APY Details page at any time by logging into your SoFi account on the SoFi mobile app or SoFi website and selecting either (i) Banking > Savings > Current APY or (ii) Banking > Checking > Current APY. Upon receiving a Direct Deposit or $5,000 in Qualifying Deposits to your account, you will begin earning 4.20% APY on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% on checking balances on or before the following calendar day. You will continue to earn these APYs for (i) the remainder of the current 30-Day Evaluation Period and through the end of the subsequent 30-Day Evaluation Period and (ii) any following 30-day Evaluation Periods during which SoFi Bank determines you to have Direct Deposit activity or $5,000 in Qualifying Deposits without interruption. SoFi Bank reserves the right to grant a grace period to account holders following a change in Direct Deposit activity or Qualifying Deposits activity before adjusting rates. If SoFi Bank grants you a grace period, the dates for such grace period will be reflected on the APY Details page of your account. If SoFi Bank determines that you did not have Direct Deposit activity or $5,000 in Qualifying Deposits during the current 30-day Evaluation Period and, if applicable, the grace period, then you will begin earning the rates earned by account holders without either Direct Deposit or Qualifying Deposits until you have Direct Deposit activity or $5,000 in Qualifying Deposits in a subsequent 30-Day Evaluation Period. For the avoidance of doubt, an account holder with both Direct Deposit activity and Qualifying Deposits will earn the rates earned by account holders with Direct Deposit. Members without either Direct Deposit activity or Qualifying Deposits, as determined by SoFi Bank, during a 30-Day Evaluation Period and, if applicable, the grace period, will earn 1.20% APY on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% APY on checking balances. Interest rates are variable and subject to change at any time. These rates are current as of 10/31/2024. There is no minimum balance requirement.

Eligible Participants: All new and existing members without any history of direct deposit transactions into their SoFi Checking and Savings account are eligible for the Direct Deposit Promotion. Members who previously enrolled in direct deposit into either SoFi Money or SoFi Checking and Savings, whether currently still enrolled or not, do not qualify for this Direct Deposit Promotion. Bonuses are limited to one per SoFi Checking and Savings account. In the case of a joint account, only the primary account holder (the member who signed up first) is eligible for a bonus. Member must have an open SoFi Checking account in good standing at the time of the bonus payment. Promotion Period: The Direct Deposit Promotion will begin on 12/7/2023 at 12:01AM ET and end on 12/31/24 at 11:59PM ET. Bonus Terms: In order to qualify for eligibility for a bonus, SoFi must receive at least one Direct Deposit (as defined below) from an Eligible Participant, the first of which must be before the end of the Promotion Period. Direct Deposit means a recurring deposit of regular income to an account holder’s SoFi Checking or Savings account, including payroll, pension, or government benefit payments (e.g., Social Security), made by the account holder’s employer, payroll or benefits provider or government agency (“Direct Deposit”) via the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) Network. Deposits that are not from an employer or government agency, including but not limited to check deposits, peer-to-peer transfers (e.g., transfers from PayPal, Venmo, etc.), merchant transactions (e.g., transactions from PayPal, Stripe, Square, etc.), and bank ACH funds transfers and wire transfers from external accounts, or are non-recurring in nature (e.g. IRS tax refunds), do not constitute Direct Deposit activity. SoFi Bank shall, in its sole discretion, assess each account holder’s Direct Deposit activity to determine eligibility and may require additional documentation to complete this verification. The amount of the bonus, if any, will be calculated during the Direct Deposit Bonus Period as described and defined below. Direct Deposit Bonus Period: The Direct Deposit Bonus Period begins when SoFi receives a Direct Deposit of $1 or more  within the Promotion Period and ends 25 calendar days later (the “Direct Deposit Bonus Period”). For the avoidance of doubt, the Direct Deposit Bonus Period shall not extend beyond the Promotion Period. The bonus amount will vary based on the total amount of Direct Deposits received during the Direct Deposit Bonus Period. Once the Direct Deposit Bonus Period has elapsed, SoFi will determine if you have met the offer requirements and will deposit any earned bonus into your checking account within seven (7) business days. For example, if SoFi receives between $1,000.00 and $4,999.99 in Direct Deposits during the Direct Deposit Bonus Period, you will receive a one-time cash bonus of $50. A member may only qualify for one bonus tier and will not be eligible for future bonus payments if Direct Deposits subsequently increase after the Direct Deposit Bonus Period. Direct Deposit Bonus Period Total Direct Deposit Amount in Direct Deposit Bonus Period Cash Bonus Tier $1.00 - $999.99 $0 $1,000.00 - $4,999.99 $50 $5,000.00 or more $300 Bonus Payment Timeline: SoFi will credit members who meet qualification criteria within seven (7) business days of the end of the Direct Deposit Bonus Period. Bonuses are considered miscellaneous income and may be reportable to the IRS on Form 1099-MISC (or Form 1042-S, if applicable). SoFi reserves the right to exclude any Members from participating in the Direct Deposit Promotion for any reason, including suspected fraud, misuse, or if suspicious activities are observed. SoFi also reserves the right to stop or change the Direct Deposit Promotion at any time. SoFi members with Direct Deposit can earn 4.20% annual percentage yield (APY) on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% APY on checking balances. There is no minimum Direct Deposit amount required to qualify for the 4.20% APY for savings (including Vaults). Members without Direct Deposit will earn 1.20% APY on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% APY on checking balances. Interest rates are variable and subject to change at any time. These rates are current as of 10/31/2024. There is no minimum balance requirement. Additional information can be found at http://www.sofi.com/legal/banking-rate-sheet .

From the very first track spikes Adi Dassler made in his workshop, creating the best gear for the athlete is what drives us to pursue technological breakthroughs and design innovations. Our sneakers and apparel are worn by world-record holders and medal winners, but it's just as important that road runners, weekend hikers, recreational soccer players, and fitness enthusiasts. From adidas Boost, the game-changing cushioning technology, to the world-beating design of Adizero Adios Pro running shoes to Terrex outdoor gear to soccer cleats with unbeatable touch, we're always iterating, innovating and improving with athletes in mind. The 3-Stripes have appeared on medal stands all around the world, but they've also had an influence that extends far beyond the field of play. adidas sneakers have been worn by hip-hop performers, skaters, artists and all the other change-makers who move the culture forward with their vision and uncompromising style. We've made our mark with legendary lifestyle shoes like the adidas Superstar, the Stan Smith and the Samba, shoes that began as athletic footwear before hitting the streets and leaving an indelible impression on the culture. adidas Originals apparel is a stylish complement to our lifestyle shoes. Our streetwear collections pull from the archives to put a modern spin on classics like the Firebird tracksuit and the Tiro pant. Luxe materials, sophisticated silhouettes and unexpected details elevate our streetwear and transcend sport while at the same time never losing sight of our heritage. Because our mantra is, and has always been, that through sport we have the power to change lives. adiclub-logo alert-error alert-info alert-success alert-warning broken-image checkmark contact-email contact-phone customization forbidden locked logo personalisation-flag personalization product rating-active rating-inactive size-guide tooltip usp-checkmark usp-delivery-cash usp-delivery-delay usp-delivery-evening usp-delivery-same-day usp-delivery-store usp-delivery usp-exchange usp-free-returns usp-gift-card usp-klarna usp-sale arrow-back arrow-down arrow-left-long arrow-left arrow-right-long arrow-right arrow-up bag-active bag-inactive calendar-active calendar-inactive chat checkbox-checkmark checkmark-full clipboard close cross-small download dropdown edit external-link filter fullscreen hamburger hd-filled hd-outline hide-active hide-inactive locate-target lock minus notification-active notification-inactive pause-outline pin-small pin play-filled play-outline plus profile reload sd-filled sd-outline search share sound-off-filled sound-off-outline sound-on-filled sound-on-outline subtitles-cc-filled subtitles-cc-outline subtitles-filled subtitles-outline wishlist-active wishlist-inactive zoom-out zoom apple facebook google instagram-filled instagram messenger pinterest runtastic tiktok-default tiktok twitter vk whatsapp yahoo youtube"

These services use this information to try to tailor the ads you see online to your interests. These are called interest-based ads. For more information about our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information when you visit our sites and apps, see our Privacy Policy. Under certain state laws, including, but not limited to, the California Consumer Privacy Act, California Privacy Rights Act, and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (collectively, “State Privacy Laws”), this collection and use of our users’ information for interest-based advertising purposes may constitute a “sale” of personal information to other parties.  Certain State Privacy Laws require that we give you the ability to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information or data in connection with these targeting advertising activities. Although State Privacy Laws only extend their protections to residents of their particular states, we respect consumer choice when it comes to privacy rights.  Accordingly, we offer all of our users – regardless of whether you are a resident of a state that has adopted a State Privacy Law – the right to opt out of this type of sale or sharing of your personal information.  You can exercise this opt-out right by using the toggle switch below. Opting out will not disable  or other technologies that facilitate the proper functioning of our website or collect data for purposes that do not involve targeted advertising. Opting out will not mean that you will stop seeing interest-based ads or other ads online. Specifically, opting out will not prevent you from seeing interest-based ads based on information that, for purposes of State Privacy Laws, was not sold or shared by us, was sold before you opted out, or was sold by third parties outside of our control. You can learn more about interest-based ads and additional opt-out choices here. In addition, if you are a California resident and have enabled the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal on a supported web browser, we will treat this as a request to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information for targeted advertising purposes.

Charles Schulz had it in his contract that nobody would take over Peanuts — and it was his children's idea One article compared it to ''asking who would paint Picassos after Picasso passed.'' Forrest Tucker, star of The Crawling Eye, called himself the last of the ''ugly guys.'' The actor wasn't concerned with looks. This was the ''secret weapon'' that made Gunsmoke so good ""They ask me when I'm going to quit and all I can keep on saying is that I'm in this saddle until it wears out."" Judy Norton didn’t always like the food served in The Waltons, even in the Thanksgiving episode She always acted the part though, and sometimes that meant taking fake bites.

This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. The strategies discussed are strictly for illustrative and educational purposes and are not a recommendation, offer or solicitation to buy or sell any securities or to adopt any investment strategy. There is no guarantee that any strategies discussed will be effective. Funds that concentrate investments in specific industries, sectors, markets or asset classes may underperform or be more volatile than other industries, sectors, markets or asset classes and than the general securities market. International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/ developing markets or in concentrations of single countries. Actively managed funds do not seek to replicate the performance of a specified index, may have higher portfolio turnover, and may charge higher fees than index funds due to increased trading and research expenses. Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in the value of debt securities. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the debt issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher-rated securities. Small-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments, and their securities may be more volatile and less liquid than larger capitalization companies. There can be no guarantee that the Buffered Funds will be successful in their strategy to provide downside protection against Underlying ETF losses. The Funds do not provide principal protection or non-principal protection, and, despite the Approximate Buffer (the “Buffer”), an investor may experience significant losses on their investment, including the loss of their entire investment. In the event an investor purchases Fund shares after a Hedge Period begins or sells Fund shares prior to the end of the Hedge Period, the returns realized by the investor will not match those that the Funds seeks to provide. In periods of extreme market volatility, the Funds' return may be subject to downside protection significantly lower than the Buffer and an upside limit significantly below the Approximate Cap (the ""Cap""). A new Cap is established during each Rebalance Period and is dependent upon current market conditions. As such, the Cap is likely to change, sometimes significantly, from one Hedge Period to the next. The Buffered Funds invest in FLEX Options that derive their value from the Underlying ETF. FLEX Options are subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation, and may be less liquid than other securities. The value of FLEX Options may be affected by interest rate changes, dividends, actual and implied volatility levels of the Underlying ETF’s share price, and the remaining time until the FLEX Options expire. Because of these factors, the Buffered Funds’ NAV may not increase or decrease at the same rate as the underlying ETF’s share price. Diversification and asset allocation may not protect against market risk or loss of principal. No proprietary technology or asset allocation model is a guarantee against loss of principal. There can be no assurance that an investment strategy based on the tools will be successful. This information should not be relied upon as research, investment advice, or a recommendation regarding any products, strategies, or any security in particular.

Here’s why they love EveryDollar: Best budgeting tool out there This has been a huge money-saver for me. I’m controlling every aspect of my finances by budgeting. It’s the foundation for everything I’m doing with my money. DC_Dave I use this app all the time I have been using EveryDollar since it launched. It replaced the other two or three budgeting apps that I had previously used, and there has been no going back. big_dan_ Simple to use yet so helpful It has really helped us visualize our spending which in return helps us manage it better. It’s a quick and convenient way to see a snapshot of what to expect for the month, especially with bills and income that fluctuate each month like utilities, etc. Holly B. Easy to use Connect it with your bank, and all your transactions drop right in. Makes budgeting easy (and actually kind of fun!) :) Highly recommend! Kim Lifesaver This budgeting app was life-changing! It helped me get out of debt, save money, and truly understand where my money goes. If you aren’t budgeting, this will be your lifesaver! Amber B. Anytime. Anywhere. Any device. Create Your Free Account Anytime. Anywhere. Any device. Create Your Free Account Anytime. Anywhere. Any device. Create Your Free Account Giving back is something that’s important to you. So why not plan for it the same way you’ll be budgeting for everything else? Using the app’s built-in Giving line item, you can quickly and easily set aside money for charity or donations every month. Even when nothing’s on fire (unless we’re talking about your rap skills), being proactive about saving gives you the relief of knowing you’ll be okay if something pops up. Because surprise expenses shouldn’t set you back on your goals. You’re giving every single dollar a job to do, telling it where to go, so you can give yourself permission to spend—guilt-free. But that doesn’t mean fun-free! So, make room for some shenanigans in your budget. You work too hard to not enjoy the money you make.

Old World New World The channel-led strategy is characterized by low retention and customer survival rates – average 22% 3-year retention rate, more than 2x lower than leading brands. This eats into a retailer’s growth and compounds over time. Teams are operating in channel silos with a short supply of signal to drive customer movement through the lifecycle and end up over-investing in bottom-funnel performance to hit year-over-year comps. Retailers and DTC brands committed to both short and long-term growth are moving to a customer-led strategy characterized by high retention rates – an average 59% 3-year retention rate, more than 2x higher compared to lagging brands. It’s anchored by processes of shopper identification, signal-based messaging, and customer analytics that result in hitting comps while also creating a more robust, active customer base. Putting a customer-led strategy into action requires a customer-first technology. Here’s how we increase reach, relevance and purchase frequency differently than other solutions. Transparent Identification Bluecore provides best-in-class identification technology alongside a proactive strategy built, tested and monitored by retail experts to continuously boost ID rates over time. Our advanced  snippet, site modals, and partner integrations capture as many identifiers as possible and our first-party ID network works to re-identify across devices and cookie-clearing, without data sharing. With robust reporting, we provide full transparency into ID rates and trends, as well as performance by source and device so retailers can optimize the highest ID rates possible. Real-time product catalog connection Bluecore is the only solution that connects to a retailer’s real-time product catalog at the SKU variant-level (stock status, size, price, color) and combines it with identification and behavioral data (we own the patent). This three-pronged dataset creates the most complete customer profiles to understand intent and preferences, which are the predictors of future behavior and conversion. This intelligence feeds more than 20 predictive models – from category and discount affinity to next-best purchase and at-risk buyers – so every message is 1:1. Hundreds of signal-based messages With shopper identity, behavioral data, product data, and predictive models built directly into campaign workflows, Bluecore turns intelligence into action. Marketers can scale the number of relevant messages with hundreds of cross-channel triggers that are ready to respond to any signal or event to keep customers engaged and purchasing at their individual moments of intent. With reduction in manual workflows, Bluecore campaigns can be built at the speed that your customer is moving, with 80% less production time compared to other providers.

Learn About AKC Government Relations Sports & Events Conformation Dog shows (officially conformation) may look like beauty pageants, but they’re not. Dogs aren’t compared against each other; they’re compared against the standards of their breed. Agility An exhilarating way to exercise with your dog, Agility is a fast-paced obstacle course with tunnels, hurdles, and other challenges that your dog completes as quickly as possible. Rally In Rally, you and your dog navigate a course, side-by-side, through 10-20 different exercises and, although it’s timed, it's more about proving excellent behavior and teamwork than speed. Fast CAT This fast-paced event features one dog running at a time, with their speed clocked and converted to MPH. Any dog over 12 months of age that are registered or enrolled with the AKC can participate. Virtual Home Manners This entirely virtual program tests for the 10 necessary skills that well-mannered dogs need in the home setting! VHM gets you started on practical skills needed before your first training class. Scent Work In AKC Scent Work, the handler guides the dog through a set search area to find specific odors that the dogs have been trained to detect. Obedience Developed in the 1930s, Obedience is one of our oldest sporting events and is open to all breeds. From walking in figure eights to sitting for 1-3 minutes, dogs show off their good behavior. Tracking Your dog’s natural ability to recognize and follow a scent is on full display in AKC Tracking events. Herding In the sport of Herding, your dog uses his innate herding abilities to move sheep (or other animals) around a field. Earth Dog Open to small terriers and Dachshunds, Earthdog tests are non-competitive and assess your dog’s abilities for seeking and locating prey underground. Field Trials Since 1924, these competitions give your pointing breed a chance to show how fast he can run and his keen desire to hunt for and find game. Hunting Hunting tests are designed to test a dog's ability to work with their human hunting companion in a simulated hunting situation. Farm Dog Certified The Farm Dog Certified test is a series of twelve exercises in a noncompetitive pass/fail evaluation and open to all dogs over nine months that are registered or enrolled with the AKC. Lure Coursing The lure will lead a pack to run as fast as they can, zig-zagging across an open field in hopes of catching it. The test is a basic performance of coursing that is non-competitive and is pass/fail. Coursing Ability Most dogs have the urge to chase different objects, whether it's a ball or each other during playtime. CAT is a non-competitive, pass/fail event that harnesses their natural instinct. Coonhound Nite Hunts require coonhounds to hunt at night with a handler and be scored on their ability to trail and tree a raccoon. It is fun to watch and the hounds enjoy doing what they were meant to do! Trick Dog Since the 1920s and '40s when trick dogs such as Rin Tin Tin and Lassie won peoples’ hearts, trick dog training has become one of the most exciting new areas in dog training today.
