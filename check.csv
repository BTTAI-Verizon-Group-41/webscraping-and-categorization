nytimes.com,News,"The New York Times - Breaking News, US News, World News and Videos Skip to content Skip to site index SKIP ADVERTISEMENT U.S. International Canada Español 中文 Today’s Paper New York Times - Top Stories 4 days What’s at Stake: Tariffs and Trade Ana Swanson Domestic Correspondent Donald Trump has proposed sweeping tariffs on imports that would raise trade barriers to a level unseen in generations. Those tariffs would protect some U.S. factories but raise costs for American households. They would also probably incite trade wars and shake the alliances the U.S. has worked to construct since World War II. Read the story Trump’s Tariffs Would Rock Global Businesses and Shake Alliances What’s at Stake: Imagining a Harris Presidency Robert Draper Domestic Correspondent Kamala Harris is shattering precedents, but it is easier to see her as president in light of her story as a daughter of motivated immigrants and as a longtime prosecutor. She favors facts over ideology. Her guardedness, as an often prejudged woman of color, makes her aware of inequities in policy. Read the story Harris’s Run Comes After a Series of Career Risks What’s at Stake: Climate Lisa Friedman Climate Policy Reporter During his presidency, Donald Trump dissolved more than 100 environmental regulations. If elected again, he would kill any federal effort to study and fight climate change, encourage oil and gas companies to “Drill, Baby, Drill” and restrict the government agency that protects air and water. Read the story A Pivotal Choice: Trump vs. Harris on Climate Change What’s at Stake: Deploying Troops on U.S. Soil Charlie Savage Domestic Correspondent Donald Trump says he’d deploy the U.S. military on domestic soil, including to suppress protests he deems riots, patrol Democratic-run cities he deems crime dens and hunt for undocumented immigrants. The strongman tactics would carry profound implications for individual rights and constraints on federal power. Read the story How Trump Would Use Soldiers Against Riots, Crime and Migrants What’s at Stake: Taxation Andrew Duehren Tax Policy Reporter Donald Trump wants to cut taxes in novel and potentially very expensive ways if he returns to the White House. He would instead impose broad tariffs on imports to fund the government. Taken together, his plans could remake the nation’s tax system, placing a greater burden on low-income Americans. Read the story Trump Promises New Tax Cuts. Other Republicans Are Wary. What’s at Stake: Kamala Harris’s Rise Astead Herndon Host of “The Run-Up” Harris’s ascent reflects a changing Democratic Party, one that has reorganized in the Trump era around reproductive rights, racial representation and protecting democracy. She’s kept a distance from the left wing, and united Democrats in a crisis — seeking to recreate the anti-Trump coalition that won victories in 2020 and 2022. Listen to the story The Daily: The Story of Kamala Harris What’s at Stake: Abortion Rights Kate Zernike Domestic Correspondent Donald Trump has boasted that he was able to kill Roe v. Wade, allowing states to ban abortion. He has said he would not sign a national ban if Congress passed one. But his allies in the anti-abortion movement have plans that would let him effectively impose such a ban without Congressional action. Read the story How a Trump Win Could Further Transform Abortion Law What’s at Stake: Rule of Law Emily Bazelon New York Times Magazine Donald Trump says he would use the power of the presidency to order F.B.I. investigations and criminal prosecutions of his political foes. He was largely thwarted in this in his first term. But the Supreme Court has made it easier for him to succeed if he gets a second chance. Read the story Why Legal Experts Are Worried About a Second Trump Presidency What’s at Stake: Immigration Jonathan Swan Political Correspondent Donald Trump’s first-term crackdown on immigration looks mild compared with his new plan. He wants to mobilize law enforcement and the military for what he’s dubbed the largest deportation operation in U.S. history: He’d round up millions of undocumented people and hold them in camps to await expulsion. Read the story Sweeping Raids and Mass Deportations: Inside Trump’s Immigration Plans What’s at Stake: 
Pace of Change Erica L. Green White House Correspondent Kamala Harris is not offering sweeping change, even as voters express dissatisfaction about the direction of the country. She’s an institutionalist who wants to preserve democratic ideals, and an incrementalist who believes progress takes time. That means her pragmatic approach could be frustrating to some supporters. Read the story A Harris Win Would Be Historic, but Her Changes Would Come ‘Step-by-Step’ What’s at Stake: Limits of Power Maggie Haberman Senior Political Correspondent We’ve spent two years examining the implications of a second Donald Trump presidency. He wants to radically reshape the federal government and consolidate executive power. He tried to do much of this in his first term but was largely stymied. Now, he’s intent on hiring people less likely to say no. Read the story Donald Trump’s Plan for a Radical Reshaping of American Government Trump Is Courting Apolitical Young Men. Will It Pay Off?

Simply place your order and choose a pickup time, and a shopper will prepare your order at the store. When you get to the store, use the Instacart app to notify us. Depending on the store, a shopper or store employee will bring the groceries to your car, or you can pick them up at the designated area. How much does Instacart cost? You don’t need a membership to order with Instacart. In fact, you can even order from warehouse clubs, like Costco, Sam’s Club, and BJ’s Wholesale Club, without a retailer club membership.

Instacart makes it easy to communicate with your shopper. When an item you want is out-of-stock at the store, your shopper will follow your replacement preferences. You can set item and delivery instructions in advance, as well as chat directly with your shopper while they shop and deliver your items. You can tell the shopper to: Find Best Match: By default, your shopper will use their best judgement to pick a replacement for your item. Pick Specific Replacement: You can pick a specific alternative for the shopper to purchase if your first choice is out-of-stock. Don’t Replace: For items you’d rather not replace, choose “Don’t replace” to get a refund if the item is out of stock. You can update or cancel your order as long as your shopper hasn’t started shopping. If you need to make changes after shopping has started, you can use the app or website to approve replacements or chat with your shopper. What happens if there's an issue with my order?

Can I get contactless delivery with Instacart? The health and safety of our community is our number one priority.

Credit Karma determines Approval Odds by comparing your credit profile to other Credit Karma members who were approved for the product shown, or whether you meet certain criteria determined by the lender. Of course, there's no such thing as a sure thing, but knowing your Approval Odds may help you narrow down your choices. For example, you may not be approved because you don't meet the lender's ""ability to pay standard"" after they verify your income and employment; or, you already have the maximum number of accounts with that specific lender. ²From December 2023 to April 2024, members with a TransUnion credit score of 619 or below who opened a Credit Builder plan and had it reported on their TransUnion report saw an average credit score increase of 21 points in 3 days of activating the plan. Late payments and other factors can have a negative impact on your score, including activity with your other credit accounts. ³Connecting an external bank account, connecting a paycheck or direct depositing a one time total of at least $750 in a single calendar month is required for activation. Your  connected external bank account, connected paycheck or direct deposit(s) must be received in the 2 calendar months prior to application or within a calendar month 90 days after application submission to activate your plan. Credit Builder plan requires you to open a line of credit and a savings account, both provided by Cross River Bank, Member FDIC. Credit Builder is serviced by Credit Karma Credit Builder. Members with a TransUnion credit score of 619 or below at the time of application may be prompted to apply for Credit Builder. If your score increases over 619, you may no longer see these prompts.

For connected paycheck: We partner with Pinwheel to securely connect you with thousands of payroll providers. Credit Karma is not a bank.

I loved Bernthal's take on the anti-hero in both the Daredevil series and Netflix's The Punisher, so his return is exciting, and Frank seems to be back in full force in the new MCU series. Felipe Felipe 2 days ago 8 Do you want to see Bill Skarsgård's Count Orlok ahead of Nosferatu's release? New character posters have been released for the upcoming Nosferatu, and yet Bill Skarsgård's Count Orlok has yet to get a proper full look. I personally hope that the studio keeps him completely under wraps until the movie's release, as it's clear that the design is going to be very different from that of prior versions, and I would love for it to be a surprise while watching it, especially if it's as horrifying as I think it will be. Grant Grant 1 day ago 2 Beyond Superman, which confirmed DCU hero are you most excited to see in the 2025 movie? While David Corenswet's debut as the Man of Steel in 2025's Superman will no doubt be exciting, he's not the only confirmed hero who will be introduced in the very first DCU movie. The Justice League International looks to be involved with characters such as Guy Gardner's Green Lantern, Mister Terrific, Hawkgirl, and Metamorpho. Beyond Superman himself, I'm very excited to see how Metamorpho will be translated into live-action. Played by Anthony Carrigan, Rex Mason aka Metamorpho can transmute his body into several elements and form them at will. As such, this will be a fascinating power to see on-screen.

Frequently asked questions Is WeightWatchers a doctor-recommended weight-loss program? WeightWatchers is the #1 doctor-recommended weight-loss program †. Additionally, our diabetes-tailored plan is based on guidelines from the American Diabetes Association and the International Diabetes Federation. † Based on a 2020 IQVIA survey of 14,000 doctors who recommend weight-loss programs to patients. How much does WeightWatchers cost? Generally, memberships start for as low as $23 per month, depending on length of commitment you choose. See offers and pricing here . How is your weight-loss program different from others? We help you lose weight and build healthy habits, one small step at a time. Fad weight-loss diets can be restrictive, and rarely work long term. We have more than 140 publications that show WeightWatchers’ efficacy to help members lose weight and keep it off. See how WeightWatchers stacks up against the competition . I’ve tried WeightWatchers before. What’s new? Our updated, simplified weight-loss program makes it easier for you to follow and find success. Every member gets a tailored Points Budget and streamlined list of over 200 ZeroPoint® foods. Compared to programs of the past, we now use advanced nutrition science to factor in more food label data, like added sugars, fiber, and unsaturated fats, to guide you toward the healthiest foods. What foods will I eat on the program? What you eat is up to you—and we’ll show you how to enjoy your favorite foods in a way that gets you to your goals. With WeightWatchers, there are no “good” or “bad” foods—just nutritious and less nutritious ones. What do I have to do to get the results I want? We make it as easy as possible. You’ll get a Points® Budget to “spend” however you want. You’ll track your meals, drinks, and snacks in the WW app and enjoy as many ZeroPoint® foods as you'd like. Activity can also boost your weight loss (vs. only focusing on food)ᶿᶿ. ᶿᶿ Johns DJ, Hartmann-Boyce J, Jebb SA, Aveyard P; Behavioural Weight Management Review Group. Diet or exercise interventions vs combined behavioral weight management programs: a systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparisons. J Acad Nutr Diet. 2014;114(10):1557–1568. doi:10.1016/j.jand.2014.07.005 ​​ᶿDF Tate et al, 12-month randomized multi-country trial comparing weight loss between the WW program to a Do-It-Yourself approach where resource guides were provided. JAMA Network Open. 2022;5(8):e2226561. Funded by WW International, Inc. Do I have to track everything? Science shows food tracking is the biggest predictor of success—the more you track, the more weight you’ll lose! But we’re all about consistency over perfection: It’s better to track some food most days of the week than every single thing you eat only some days of the week. In other words, perfection is not required. You’ll quickly decide how to approach tracking in a way that works for you. Here are some of our best tracking tips . What are ZeroPoint® foods? They are nutritional powerhouses that serve as the foundation of healthy eating and support your overall health. ZeroPoint foods also add bulk and flavor to meals, without costing Points® from your Budget, so you don’t have to weigh, measure, or track these foods—no matter how many you eat in a day! Those 200-plus foods include  non-starchy veggies, fruit, eggs, yogurt, cottage cheese, fish, shellfish, chicken and turkey breast, and more. Who are WeightWatchers experts? Our team includes nutrition and behavioral scientists, registered dieticians, clinical researchers, and more. Together they help you overcome common weight-loss hurdles—like stress-eating or late-night snacking—while our exclusive Points system makes nutrition easier —so easy that healthier eating will feel like second nature. After you sign up, you’ll answer a few questions to get a plan customized for you, and build healthy habits with proven behavior change techniques. What are Workshops? Our Workshops (or Meetings, back in the day) are coach-led group sessions held in a Studio location or online. You don’t need to go, but the extra support can ramp up your results: Workshop members lose two times more weight than those who DIY.^ Workshops offer unlimited accountability, and give you a sense of belonging alongside coaches and members who really get it. ^^Based on a 6-month multicenter trial.

LastPass is accessible on computers (MacOS, Windows, Linux, Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and mobile devices (iOS, WatchOS, and Android). Free users can only use LastPass on one device type (computer or mobile), while paid users have unlimited access. How does LastPass securely store passwords? Your LastPass vault secures your data on your trusted device through zero-knowledge encryption. Your device encrypts and hashes your passwords locally before sending them to LastPass servers. The next time you need to log in, LastPass returns your encrypted passwords – which are decrypted by your trusted device. Does LastPass have access to my passwords? No, our zero-knowledge security model ensures your data remains yours: your master passwords and anything you store in your password vault – passwords, credit cards, mailing addresses, secure notes – are never visible or accessible to LastPass. How does LastPass encryption work? LastPass is built on a zero-knowledge encryption method , which ensures you are the only person who knows your master password – the key used to decrypt your password vault. Thanks to 256-bit AES encryption and PBKDF2 derivation function with a secure hash (SHA256), with salting, your master password is never stored on our servers in its plaintext format, so only you will know what it is. Is LastPass no longer safe? LastPass secures all passwords, so you don't have to, ensuring that your most important credentials are protected, private, and always within reach. We have undergone an extensive security transformation; emerging as a stronger, more innovative, and independent company with an unwavering commitment to security, privacy, and customer satisfaction. We seized a unique opportunity to implement an entirely new security and privacy infrastructure across our development and production environments, moved to a purpose-built, highly available and secure Cloud platform, rolled out an entirely new fleet of managed end user devices, and enhanced security and privacy within our digital vault, including achieving ISO 27701 compliance. We’ve also invested significant resources to strengthen our privacy and security teams, establishing new business units, such as our Privacy Operations, Safety and Trust (POST) team, which focuses on safeguarding customer privacy and protecting against fraud and abuse. Additionally, our new Threat Intelligence, Mitigation, and Escalation (TIME) team provides actionable security insights and advanced threat intelligence on LastPass Labs, our content hub for the market and our customers. We have documented so much of this journey through updated support articles and close to real-time monitoring of LastPass systems within our new Compliance Center, keeping customers informed every step of the way. What is the deal with LastPass? LastPass is a popular password manager that helps users store and manage their passwords. In December 2022, LastPass disclosed a security incident. LastPass remains committed to delivering a secure set of products and services for LastPass customers, and is continuously making improvements and investments across people, processes, and infrastructure to deliver on this commitment. By streamlining the process of password management and enhancing security, LastPass provides a comprehensive solution for individuals and businesses looking to protect their digital identities. This article contains additional details on what has been done to secure LastPass . Where is the safest place to keep passwords? The safest place to keep your passwords is in a password manager like LastPass. Password managers securely store your login credentials in an encrypted vault, ensuring that only you can access them. By using a password manager, you can generate and store strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts, significantly reducing the risk of your credentials being compromised. This method not only enhances your overall security but also simplifies the process of managing multiple passwords, making it easier to maintain good password hygiene. For additional details, you can visit LastPass vault to learn more. What's more secure than LastPass? When considering alternatives to LastPass, it’s important to look for password managers that offer robust encryption, security audits and transparent privacy policies. While LastPass is a robust and secure password manager, it's important to note that all password managers face common threats, such as phishing attacks. To ensure maximum security, users should regularly update their password manager software, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and stay vigilant against phishing attempts. It's crucial to prioritize strong security practices, such as using a unique and complex master password and setting up secure recovery options. Additionally, users should be cautious about where they enter their master password and be aware of the signs of phishing scams. By combining a reliable password manager with these best practices, users can significantly enhance their overall digital security. For additional details, you can visit the LastPass security page or our support site to learn what makes LastPass secure . What are the disadvantages of LastPass? Some users find the limited features of the LastPass free version a disadvantage. Paid plans offer more functionality, for a fee. Users of the free version may miss functionalities such as password sharing, personal customer support, and emergency access. These limitations can be a drawback for individuals who require more robust password management tools but do not want to subscribe to the paid plans. Additionally, the free version limits users to syncing their passwords on only one type of device—either mobile or desktop.

I'm currently between an old favorite and a new release! With the remaster of Horizon: Zero Dawn dropping, I've got another excuse to dive into Aloy's story and boy, what a great story it is. On the other hand, I've also got a lore-rich and content-heavy RPG in Dragon Age: The Veilguard on my PlayStation, so I'll be kept pretty preoccupied getting through both of these big franchise installments!

Admittedly, I've never really been drawn to horror games, just as I've never been an avid fan of horror films, but everyone I ask tells me that Amnesia: The Dark Descent certainly gets hearts racing. From personal experience, it would be Alan Wake 2, but even then I wouldn't say it was absolutely terrifying (although, it was a very, very good game!) Tim Tim 1 day ago 156 Which Class Will You Play As First in Dragon Age: The Veilguard? I always favor ranged combat in RPGs, so the Rogue class sounds more up my alley. It'll largely depend on how the archery combat feels, but I'll probably go for opt for a specialization that supports my relentless desire to fire headshots with a bow in hand. That's not to say I won't try them all, this game certainly seems replayable enough to have a couple of runs.

Bland Cowboys CB 5 mins ago DaRon Bland : Won’t play Sunday Bland (foot) has been ruled out ahead of Sunday's matchup against the Falcons. The third-year corner from Fresno State was activated from injured reserve Wednesday; however, it appears that his foot issue is still bothering him enough to miss the Cowboys' Week 9 contest. Bland's 2024 debut will have to wait at least one more week, with Andrew Booth and Caelen Carson expected to see increased work in the Cowboys' secondary in Bland's stead. Read More M. Parsons Cowboys LB 9 mins ago Micah Parsons : Remains out in Week 9 Parsons (ankle) has been ruled out ahead of Sunday's matchup against the Falcons. Parsons has yet to return to practice since sustaining a high-ankle sprain in the Cowboys' Week 4 win over the Giants, and he's now in line to miss his fourth consecutive game Sunday. The 2021 first-round pick has recorded 14 total tackles, including 1.0 sacks, and defended one pass through four appearances this season. Expect Tyrus Wheat and Carl Lawson to see increased work with the Cowboys' first-team defense while Parsons remains sidelined in Week 9. Read More C. Flott Giants CB 15 mins ago Cor'Dale Flott : Past groin issue Flott (groin) has no injury designation ahead of Sunday's matchup against the Commanders, Patricia Traina of SI.com reports. Flott logged a week of limited practice sessions after missing the Giants' Week 8 loss to the Steelers due to a groin issue. Expect the third-year pro to serve as the Giants' No. 3 outside cornerback behind both Deonte Banks and Nick McCloud in Week 9 now that he's returned to full health.

Theis Pelicans F-C 4 mins ago Daniel Theis : Expected to suit up Friday Coach Willie Green said Theis (ankle) is expected to suit up for Friday's game against the Pacers, Christian Clark of The New Orleans Times-Picayune reports. Theis left Wednesday's loss to Golden State early after sustaining a right ankle injury, though he is not expected to miss any time. Through five regular-season outings, the 32-year-old has averaged 4.0 points, 4.4 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 1.6 stocks across 16.0 minutes per game. Read More J. Hawkins Pelicans G 9 mins ago Jordan Hawkins : Expected to play Friday Coach Willie Green said Hawkins (back) is expected to play in Friday's game versus the Pacers, Christian Clark of The New Orleans Times-Picayune reports.

Globally, about one-third of countries have had a female head of state, with significant progress made in recent years. In the 2020s alone, more than 10 countries have elected their first female leader, including Bosnia and Herzegovina , Democratic Republic of the Congo , Estonia , Honduras , Italy , and Mexico . The Countries Where Women Have Taken the Reins Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc./Kenny Chmielewski An Interactive Timeline of Women Leaders (L-R) © Spencer Platt/Getty Images; © Nelson Antoine/Shutterstock.com; Richard Nixon Library/NARA 6 of the First Women Heads of State © Gerald B. Johnson/U.S. Department of Defense Discover More Quiz: Women in Power Quiz: Women Leaders Throughout History A Fistful of Zeros A Russian court has levied one heck of a fine against Google for blocking its state media on YouTube : 20 decillion rubles. The fine, which grows every day, equates to more than the gross domestic product of the entire world (estimated at $110 trillion). So, exactly how big is an decillion, and what comes after it? How big is a decillion? A decillion is such a large number—1 followed by 33 zeros—that you rarely come across it. For context, scientists estimate that there are 7.5 quintillion grains of sand on Earth, and a quintillion is just 18 zeros. How about stars in the sky? Astronomers estimate that the Milky Way Galaxy consists of several hundred billion stars , which, though a large number, accounts for only 11 zeros. So even if each star in our galaxy and each grain of sand on Earth were represented by a ruble , that still wouldn’t be enough to pay Russia’s fine. How high can you go? After decillion comes undecillion (36 zeros), duodecillion (39 zeros), tredecillion (42 zeros), quattuordecillion (45 zeros), and so on. What’s next? Coincidentally, it’s called a googol—a number followed by 100 zeros. After googol comes centillion (303 zeros), and once you get to googolplex—a 1 followed by a googol of zeros—you’ve entered an abstract realm. Even the act of writing out the number on a piece of paper would be impossible because, as astronomer Carl Sagan said in the PBS documentary Cosmos , “A piece of paper large enough to contain all the zeros in a googolplex couldn’t be stuffed into the known universe.” Popular on Britannica Articles Halloween Diwali United States Presidential Election Results Aaron Judge Manichaeism Valencia War and Peace Los Angeles Dodgers All Saints’ Day United States Electoral College Votes by State Show More Show Less Features How Many Electoral College Votes Does Each U.S. State Have?

Threads More Jill Roberts is the best Ghostface in the Scream franchise The Scream series has had its fair share of memorable killers, from the originals, Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard, to Laurie Metcalf and Jack Quaid. However, the best Ghostace in the series is Emma Roberts' Jill Roberts from Scream 4. Sidney's (Neve Campbell) niece turns out to be a psychopathic, fame-hungry murderer who is willing to do everything necessary to get under that spotlight. This twist is arguably the most surprising in the franchise, largely thanks to Roberts' casting. You might know her now for playing iconic mean girls like Chanel Oberlin and Madison Montgomery, but back in 2011, Roberts was the epitome of the girl next door, best known for projects like Unfabulous and Hotel for Dogs. Scream 4 changed the direction of her career, and audiences were more than a bit shocked to see she was so great at being bad. Plus, that scene where she hurts herself to make it seem as though Ghostface attacked her? Iconic, possibly the best sequence in the long-running franchise. What David David 2 days ago 9 Which Batman character should get the next Matt Reeves spin-off? Colin Farrell's performance as Oz Cobb in Matt Reeves' The Batman and Max's series The Penguin is incredible. Not only does the actor completely transform, but the supporting characters are just as captivating, and Gotham has never felt more real while still teetering into that DC comic feel. So, who of Batman's friends or foes do you want to see get the Reeves treatment next? Tamera Tamera 1 day ago 2 What are your early predictions for next year's Oscars? It's hard to believe we're nearing the end of the year. Most of the big awards contenders have already screened at various film festivals, outside of a few exceptions.

Kyle Dvorchak , Kyle Dvorchak , What college football should learn from 8-0 Indiana and first-year coach Curt Cignetti The Hoosiers are winning now, and Curt Cignetti, in just the first year of a six-year, $27 million deal, is the runaway favorite for National Coach of the Year. Nicole Auerbach , Nicole Auerbach , Latest Player News NFL MLB NBA All Player News Calvin Ridley TEN Wide Receiver #0 Personalize your Rotoworld feed by favoriting players Calvin Ridley (shoulder) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 9 against the Patriots. Ridley missed Wednesday’s practice with the shoulder issue but was back on the field as a full participant on Thursday. The Titans gave him Friday off as a rest day. With no competition for targets, Ridley has one of the highest target share projections in the league. Tennessee’s quarterback play will continue to take a toll on his fantasy production, but Ridley showed his spike game potential last week with 10 grabs for 143 yards. He is holding steady in the WR3 ranks for Week 9. Tyler Boyd is listed as questionable with a shoulder injury of his own. Tony Pollard TEN Running Back #20 Tony Pollard (foot) is questionable for Week 9 against the Patriots. Pollard did not practice this week before being given the questionable tag. That is normally a clear indicator that a player will not suit up, but, with Tyjae Spears already ruled out, the Titans are giving him until the last minute to turn things around. Pollard will have the Tennessee backfield to himself once again if he manages to play. Facing off against a poor Patriots run defense, Pollard will stay in the RB2 ranks if active. Brian Robinson Jr. WAS Running Back #8 Brian Robinson (hamstring) is questionable for Week 9 against the Giants. Robinson was limited in all three practice sessions this week. He should be able to suit up on Sunday, but fantasy managers will want to check Washington’s inactives before kickoff to be safe. If active, Robinson will push for an RB2 ranking versus the Giants. Austin Ekeler would be in line for a strong workload and an RB2 ranking of his own if Robinson can’t go. Jayden Daniels WAS Quarterback #5 Jayden Daniels (ribs) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 9 against the Giants. Daniels played through the rib injury last week without any notable issues. He threw for 328 yards plus a touchdown and toppled No. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams with a hail mary for the history books. Daniels will remain a top-five fantasy quarterback for his Week 9 game against the Giants. Jared Goff DET Quarterback #16 Jared Goff (ankle) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 9 against the Packers. No surprises here as Goff was upgraded to a full practice on Thursday after being held out of Wednesday’s session. Goff had his ankle rolled on by a Tennessee defender early in Detroit’s Week 8. he played through the issue without any major problems despite having a noticeable limp at times. While he may be slightly less mobile than usual, Goff is good to go for Week 9. He will sit on the QB1/2 border for his matchup with Green Bay. Derek Carr NO Quarterback #4 Derek Carr (oblique) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 9 against the Panthers. Carr is good to go after missing three games with the oblique injury. He returns to a team without Rashid Shaheed or rookie wideout Bub Means. The Saints’ offensive line, on the other hand, is trending in the right direction health-wise. Carr’s pace had cooled dramatically before he went down in Week 5, but a date with the Panthers defense should get him back on track in his Week 9 return. He sits at the top of the QB2 ranks this week. Jakobi Meyers LV Wide Receiver #16 Jakobi Meyers (ankle) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 9 against the Bengals. Meyers was limited in Wednesday’s practice but returned for two full sessions before being removed from the injury report. He will likely have his practice reps managed going forward but isn’t at risk of missing any playing time barring any setbacks. Meyers reeled in 6-of-7 targets for 52 yards and a score in Week 8. Serving as the Raiders’ No. 1 receiver, Meyers is on the WR2/3 border for Week 9. Zack Moss CIN Running Back #31 Zack Moss (neck) is doubtful for Week 9 against the Raiders. Moss’s addition to the injury report comes as a surprise to everyone, even the local reporters. He was not on the teams’ report before being listed as a DNP and doubtful on Friday. Moss is all but certain to miss Week 9 despite the doubtful tag leaving some margin for error. Chase Brown should dominate the backfield work in his absence. With no competition for touches, Brown will flirt with an RB1 ranking heading into a great matchup with the Raiders. Quentin Johnston LAC Wide Receiver #1 Quentin Johnston (ankle) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 9 against the Browns. Johnston has been out since suffering a likely high-ankle sprain in Week 6. He had three touchdowns through five games but a high-water mark of 51 receiving yards. LA is passing the ball more often now, but Ladd McConkey has also cemented himself as the team’s top wideout. Johnston will sit on the WR4/5 border for his Week 9 return. T.J. Hockenson MIN Tight End #87 T.J. Hockenson (knee) was removed from the injury report and will play in Week 9 against the Colts. Hockenson will suit up for the first time since suffering a torn ACL and MCL late in the 2023 season. He averaged 6.3 catches for 64 yards last year and will take his spot in the TE1 ranks once he is fully up to speed this year. That may not happen in his first game off injured reserve, so fantasy managers should proceed with caution this week. Hockenson sits at the top of the TE2 ranks for now, though that won’t last long.

Immer schon.

Räum das Essen weg,
ehe du schlafen gehst.
Sie dürfen doch nicht auf die Anrichte?
Aber nachts schläfst du. Also räum auf.
Da gewöhnt man sich dran.

Ich hab Katzen.

Etwas klappert. Etwas knarrt.
Etwas fällt um in der Nacht.
Ein Schatten huscht vorbei.
Ich seh's aus dem Augenwinkel.
Es macht mir keine Angst

Ich hab Katzen

diese Federn wären was Schönes.

knistern wie Aluminiumbälle.
und aus der leeren Klorolle

Ich hab Katzen

und das klingt nach scharren im Streu
und das sind Pfotentapser
und das Krallen auf Parkett

Da gewöhnt man sich dran

Aber dann war September
und das Schreien kenn ich nicht.
Ich kenn nur, wenn sie nichts mehr fressen.

Add a Cover Image

 
Adding a Profile cover image is a great starting point for all deviants, and it’s easy to do! 

When creating a cover image for your Profile, the recommended dimensions are 1600 pixels by 800 pixels and 1920x1080 resolution at minimum, so the image fits well and appears clearly for all viewers.

Shock shock shock when does it stop?
Give us the daily news for our consumption
Caught up in the daily turmoil of human strife

Shock shock shock out of control
Shock shock shock treat us as fools
A game played in advance by those clever enough
To manipulate existence into an incessant meatgrinder

1 out of 10, 2 out of a 100, 30 out of 1000, 400 out of 10,000
Unceasing competition to have a job, some money and security
Just jump on a course that will take you through the life cycles required 
To end up at the end of a ride back to the same place that was commenced

Back from work to a home to turn on a video screen in front of your face
Shocking scenes appear that tell you what is going on in a forsaken world around you
Perhaps forsaken already by benevolent Gods who have given up
On the evil and menace that their creation became, much twisted and deranged

A limited way of living, a set form that conforms to a stale norm

(Not to mention the other goals you can track, including weight, exercise, steps, and intermittent fasting.) Simply log the foods you eat using one of our easy food tracking tools, and we'll show you a complete nutritional breakdown for each food, meal, day, and even week. Any way you want to look at your data, you'll gain a better understanding of your personal nutrition so you can make smart choices that align with your weight, health, and fitness goals. Does MyFitnessPal use a BMI calculator or BMR calculator to set goals? Yes, MyFitnessPal uses a BMR calculator to help you set calorie goals. During signup, you'll be asked questions about your height, weight, age, and sex to estimate your BMR (basal metabolic rate). You can also estimate your own BMR with our BMR calculator . The equation used to calculate BMR is called the Mifflin St. Jeor equation* and it takes into account your typical activity level during the day to calculate your daily calorie needs. Depending on your weight goals, we either add or subtract calories from your daily calorie needs (500 calories per pound of weight change per week desired). To help you set safe weight goals during signup, we use a BMI calculator. BMI is based on the ratio of your weight to your height, and we don't allow you to set weight goals below a certain ratio. *The Mifflin St. Jeor equation is considered to be the best estimation of calorie needs compared to other equations, being able to get within 10% of your actual energy needs on average. Can I track weight, workouts, water, or intermittent fasting? Yes! The best thing about MyFitnessPal is that it's an all-in-one app. You don't need a separate intermittent fasting app, or different apps for water tracking, weight tracking, or fitness tracking. All MyFitnessPal members can track their weight goals, exercise, and water intake alongside calories and nutrition. MyFitnessPal Premium members have many additional features, including our NEW Intermittent Fasting Tracker. Learn more about Premium and try it free . If you do use other apps and fitness devices as part of your overall health and wellness goals, more than 35 apps and fitness devices connect to MyFitnessPal. Automatically sync your steps, calorie burn, weight, and even sleep! Connect to Apple Watch, Fitbit, Garmin, Samsung Health, Google Fit, Health Connect, smart scales, and many more.

Set a price range by type of items (tops, pants, dresses, etc.) and we’ll stick to it (unless you give us permission for the occasional splurge). We carry a variety of price points: women’s and men’s items start at around $28, and run all the way up to about $500. And our kids’ items start at only $12. You’ll pay a $20 styling fee per Fix order, which is then credited to whatever you keep. Love it all? Get a 25% discount when you keep everything in your Fix. Shipping, returns and exchanges are always free. (PS: We always send a preprinted, prepaid label for the most hassle-free returns.) Is this a subscription? There is no subscription required. Your Stitch Fix experience is totally up to you. You can choose automatic deliveries as an easy way to get fresh style to your door on a regular schedule. Opt in to receive your Fixes at a frequency that’s right for you—every 2-3 weeks, every month, every other month or every three months. Prefer to get your Fixes on demand? No problem, just order whenever you’re looking for a wardrobe refresh. How do you nail my fit? First, your style quiz gives us an understanding of your sizes and how you like your clothes to fit. We carry tons of brands in a wide range of sizes so our fashion Stylists can send you the best-fitting pieces. With each Fix, we’re able to further perfect your fit, knowing the items that have (and haven’t) worked for you. The more Fixes you get, the more precisely “you” they become. We always factor in the notes you send to your Stylist, too. How does my Stylist know what to send me? Your online Stylist is your partner in style. They’re here to listen and help you achieve your best personal style. The more you share with us, the more your online Stylist will know what you love. Your style quiz answers help us get an idea of pieces you’ll like and match you with a Stylist. With each order, they get to know your style even better via the items that have (and haven’t) worked for you. You can also leave a note for your Stylist whenever you schedule a style box shipment. Looking to update your workwear wardrobe? Have an event or vacation coming up? Big life change? Let us know! In addition to the notes, some other tools we use to help send you pieces personalized just for you are: keeping your style profile up to date, giving feedback on the items in each Fix and your Fix history (what you keep and what you return). How do I communicate with my Stylist? You can leave a note for your online personal Stylist whenever you schedule your next Fix—you can edit this note as much as you want up to the time your Stylist gets started. View, edit or add to your note directly on your Fixes page or in the Stitch Fix app after scheduling. What is StyleFile? We’re glad you asked! StyleFile is an all-new, personalized experience that reveals your unique style personality. StyleFile is a helpful tool that makes understanding your personal style easy. Start by exploring your unique combination of 5 style types, then get inspired by the details of your style personality. Of course, your StyleFile helps your Stitch Fix Stylist curate a Fix that’s incredibly personal to you.  Another pro? It makes shopping on your own a little less stressful—and a lot more fun. Don’t forget to share the fun—see what your friends and family got, and compare StyleFile notes. Want to learn more about the StyleFile experience? Check out our blog! What range of sizes do you carry? We carry a wide range of sizes for women, men and kids: Women: XS-3X (including petite, plus + maternity) Men: XS-3XL (including big + tall) Kids: 2T-18 Do you have kids' clothing? We sure do! We carry kids’ clothes in sizes 2T - 18—starting at just $12. Do you offer petites and plus sizes? Yes. We carry petite clothes styles designed with narrower shoulders, shorter sleeves and just-right hemlines in sizes from XS and 0, as well as petite plus sizes. We also have an extensive selection of perfect-fitting plus-size styles designed for curves (like jeans you’ll love and trending looks) in sizes up to 24W and 3X. How about maternity clothing? Yes. We offer personalized style for this exciting time for moms to be. Your Stylist might even be one of the first to know you’re expecting. From cute, versatile styles that grow with you to easy-to-wear pieces that’ll help you feel confident in your new routine, we’ve got you covered for every stage. What brands do you carry? We carry 1,000+ brands and styles for women, men and kids. You’ll find familiar faves like Madewell, The North Face, Free People, Adidas, Beyond Yoga and many more in addition to a variety of Stitch Fix exclusive brands. For a full list, click here . Can I browse and purchase pieces on my own? Yes, we call it “Freestyle.” Once you’ve received your first Fix, you’ll find the Freestyle tab on your profile—you can browse your personalized Freestyle shop, curated with pieces just for you. With Freestyle, you can browse suggestions for items that complete your Fix looks, discover what’s trending for you based on your style preferences and so much more. Obsessed with a certain piece you wear again and again? Or did your Stylist send you the perfect pair of jeans? You can also shop for new colors, prints or sizes of pieces you’ve already purchased and have to have more of. How often will I receive a Fix? It’s totally up to you! You can choose automatic deliveries as an easy way for fresh style to come on a regular schedule. Opt in to receive your Fixes at a frequency that’s right for you—every 2-3 weeks, every month, every other month or every three months. Prefer to get your Fixes on demand? No problem, just order a clothing box whenever you’re looking for a wardrobe refresh. How can I shop for my whole family? With Stitch Fix’s personal styling service, it’s so easy to get personalized style for everyone, all in one place. We have lots of amazing clothes for women, men and kids—let our Stylists do the shopping for the whole family! When you create a Kids profile , we automatically convert your account to a family account, where you can manage Fixes for each family member. A family account consists of one adult and can include up to four kids. Everyone shares the same billing and shipping information. Learn more about family accounts here . Can I have my partner on my account? Currently, there can only be one adult and up to four kids per account. We make sure to understand each individual's unique styling needs, so every adult has their own account with personal preferences and suggestions. If your partner hasn't signed up for their own Stitch Fix experience yet, you'll both get a credit if you refer them to set up an account! Let's get started"

I transferred a patient to another hospital several years ago and was able to quickly fax and send patient info via the Doximity app to my former medical school classmate who was working at the other hospital. It was 3am and the patient was admitted directly to the ICU. It was fantastically smooth and saved us so much time rather than having to traditionally fax medical records and information. Every little bit of time helps. - Gavin Harris, Internal Medicine I use this application on a daily basis. I use the Doximity dialer to call patients from my personal phone so that my personal number doesn't show up on their caller ID. Nothing but praise. Thanks, Doximity! - Doximity App Store Review I frequently consult my colleagues in different specialties using the Doximity app. I frequently utilize Doximity to access articles for teaching rounds as well as sharing articles with my colleagues.

When I went to use my gift card at an Ulta store the employee used scissors to scratch off the pin which ultimately scratched off the entire pin so it was not visible. I contacted their gift card support and the first person I was speaking too found it and said I would receive a e-gift card within 48 hours. I never received and reached out about the status... their customer service was absolutely terrible saying they couldn't find it then they couldn't do anything because it was purchased at a 3rd party seller. So I contacted Target where the gift card was purchased and they stated when the gift card is purchased it automatically transferred to Ulta and the funds are under Ulta. So Ulta lied... reached back out to them and they can see the balance of the gift card, they received pictures of the gift card and a reference # from Target regarding the situation. Then they wanted proof of purchase... well it was a GIFT I did not buy the gift card I received it as a GIFT. They refuse to do anything about it so they are basically stealing $25 from the person who purchased it. If you are going to make gift cards and have to scratch off a pin to use it they should have better quality so the pins cannot be easily ruined. What SCAMs, LIARS and thief's. Do not purchase gift cards from them they'll just keep the money for themselves.  If you can pull the gift card up and see there is a balance and have proof of the actual gift card it shouldn't be impossible to get a replacement. Especially when one of their employees scratched off the pin. They lied saying only the 3rd party seller could handle it and when the first person I spoke to said I would get a e-gift card. Ulta Beauty www.ulta.com Element Banned few months ago, i bought a service for rank 1, yeah i know pretty lame, i wanted some high tier rewards for that weekend for some content, next day i got banned, i appealed and lost everything from main account to linked accounts, everything, they use cheats to get through to rank 1, yep, they cheat, i bought a few last years game because of some weekends i was away, ofc again for content, but every time i checked player stats, they were on 50 odd games played with like 2 goals on everyone, yeah weird, i also made a funny team one weekend, let them play, got back to a 65 game played card with 2 goals, and oh yeah he was a striker, so i believe they're cheating and i got banned for it, extremely dissapointed to losing my main account, i'll never get back on U7, i deleted my account on there too, absolute scams! U7BUY u7buy.com Nick Mitten Had the most amazing experience n the highlights of Jordan tour- so many great experiences- would highly recommend.
We were in a group of 13 travellers of several different nationalities and all got on really well.
If you are lucky to get Wasfi as your CEO you won’t be disappointed he is funny, informative and helpful and made this trip extra special.
Really enjoyed Little Petra and Dead Sea and Petra is awe inspiring truly an amazing experience and never felt unsafe in Jordan, one of my best ever trips!!! G Adventures gadventures.com Lorraine Farrell I’m not well versed in lending and financials but my representative,  Hisham Abouraya, was so patient and explained every step and section of the application in a detailed way I could understand. Any question I had he answered knowledgeably, professionally, but most of all with kindness. Hisham’s recommendations of various lawyers for me to select and work with made the whole process go smoothly. From start to finish I would recommend CHIP Mortgage and especially Hisham. Thank you CHIP Reverse Mortgage chip.ca Prageeth Mendis We travelled to England and Europe and I bought a sim here from Bouygues. It worked like a charm, it really made a huge positive difference to our trip. We were able to navigate ourselves everywhere, use our apps. It was the best 30 bucks I had spent in my life. Considering I pay $50 a month for my cell phone in Canada and the calls drop in my own house this was beyond my imagination. Fantastic ! Totally recommend this. If this works in Canada I ll get one for day use.. SimOptions www.simoptions.com ED WILLIAMS ""I would give my AnyVan driver a 5-star rating! He was friendly and professional throughout the entire process. He was keen to ensure everything was to my satisfaction and didn't rush off until I was completely happy.  I appreciated that he kept me updated on his arrival time, especially since he had a busy day with lots of jobs.  He arrived exactly when he said he would, which is impressive given his workload. Very professional and highly recommended. Great service!"" AnyVan anyvan.com Amy My husband and I attended a Fife & Forth Valley class and it was great! Lynsay, the trainer, was so friendly, knowledgeable and made everyone feel really at ease with asking questions and practicing on dummies.

We attended the class as we have a 6 month old daughter and weren't very confident with what to do in an emergency situation. We now both feel so much more confident due to how much we learned from Lynsay. We honestly can't thank her enough!! Mini First Aid minifirstaid.co.uk Kevin Today I went in to a store in Ipswich at Commercial road I was met with a fantastic Toolstation employee who couldn't be more helpful and polite he went the extra mile to advise me on the best product  he was very knowledgeable to the DIY products and was patient  with me and i was though what  a nice positive store to visit  best customer service I have ever had in any trade /DIY store in Ipswich Toolstation www.toolstation.com a name NZ Post delivery target for my package, as per their website: 3-6 days

15 October package sent...

22 October finally leaves NZ...

27 October arrives at AUs sorting centre

01 Nov package still not delivered

Ridiculous even if their target time was 15+ days, but allowing customers to think it will be sooner when they know it won't be is deceptive. New Zealand Post www.nzpost.co.nz Lesa McClain I worked with Ryan and he was very nice and knowledgeable. He went out of his way to contact the dealership that I would use, with me on the line, that I had contacted to see if they took the American Dream and had said they didn’t. The issue was that they hadn’t worked with them before. I was impressed that he took this extra step. American Dream Auto Protect americandreamautoprotect.com Aaron Lotz You have to wait almost 2 weeks for your delivery to arrive.

[email protected] 866-540-6005 Mon - Thurs Fri Sat Sun 9am - 9pm ET 9am - 7pm ET 10am - 6pm ET Closed What is Credible? Credible is a marketplace that allows you to compare financial products from multiple providers side-by-side. Credible is not a lender, a bank or a credit card issuer — we partner with top financial service providers so that they can provide you with a variety of competitive options, enabling you to quickly find the right financial product for your needs. Best of all, comparing rates on Credible is completely free and won't impact your credit score! You can find out more about our company on our About Us page . Will comparing rates impact my credit score? Nope! Credible performs a ""soft credit inquiry"" to provide personalized prequalified rates for the loan products on our site. Soft credit inquiries do not affect your credit score. Once you choose a loan product on your Credible Dashboard, and once you decide to move forward with a particular lender, a hard credit inquiry will be performed, which will impact your score. Likewise, if you apply for a credit card, the credit card issuer will perform a hard credit inquiry when you apply for a credit card. What makes Credible different from other comparison sites? With Credible’s lending marketplace, you can fill out a simple, streamlined form, and instantly see which lenders you prequalify for and at what rates. These are personalized, prequalified rates based on your credit history. Checking your prequalified rates with Credible will not affect your credit score. Many other comparison sites will only provide you with generic information about a given financial service provider — the rates and information you see will not be specific to you and your credit history. You might be able to go to a specific lender’s website and see your personalized prequalified rates, but you’ll only be able to do this for one lender at a time. How does Credible get paid? We want this to be a “win-win” situation. So we only want to get paid if we bring you value in the form of finding a personal finance option that works for you. The way we earn money depends a bit on the product that you use, so here’s a breakdown of how that works on Credible. For student loans and student loan refinance, Credible receives compensation from our lending partner when we help you find a product from one of our lending partners. The compensation does not impact how and where lenders appear on our site, and Credible charges charges you no fees of any sort. For personal loans, Credible receives compensation from the lender if you finish the loan process and a loan is disbursed. The amount of our compensation does not impact how and where lenders appear on our site, and Credible charges you no fees of any sort. Some lenders may take traffic sources into account when offering credit terms. For mortgages (purchase and refinance), after you prequalify and review and select a lender participating on our platform, we will transmit the information you shared with us to your lender, who will contact you and enable you to complete a mortgage application with them. Generally, our lenders pay us and incorporate the cost of our services as part of the final interest rate on your loan, or in your loan amount. You don’t pay anything to Credible if your loan does not close. This is common practice in mortgage transactions where you find your lender through a lender-review platform like ours, also known as a “lead generator.” Read our full FAQ 1 Personal Loans Rate and Terms Disclosure: Rates for personal loans provided by lenders on the Credible platform range between 6.99% - 35.99% APR with terms from 12 to 120 months. Rates presented include lender discounts for enrolling in autopay and loyalty programs, where applicable. Actual rates may be different from the rates advertised and/or shown and will be based on the lender’s eligibility criteria, which include factors such as credit score, loan amount, loan term, credit usage and history, and vary based on loan purpose. The lowest rates available typically require excellent credit, and for some lenders, may be reserved for specific loan purposes and/or shorter loan terms. The origination fee charged by the lenders on our platform ranges from 0% to 12%. Each lender has their own qualification criteria with respect to their autopay and loyalty discounts (e.g., some lenders require the borrower to elect autopay prior to loan funding in order to qualify for the autopay discount). All rates are determined by the lender and must be agreed upon between the borrower and the borrower’s chosen lender. For a loan of $10,000 with a three year repayment period, an interest rate of 7.99%, a $350 origination fee and an APR of 10.43%, the borrower will receive $9,650 at the time of loan funding and will make 36 monthly payments of $313.32, assuming your lender deducts the origination fee from the offered loan amount. Assuming all on-time payments, and full performance of all terms and conditions of the loan contract and any discount programs enrolled in included in the APR/interest rate throughout the life of the loan, the borrower will pay a total of $11,279.43. As of March 3, 2022, none of the lenders on our platform require a down payment nor do they charge any prepayment penalties. Prequalified rates are based on the information you provide and a soft credit inquiry. Receiving prequalified rates does not guarantee that the Lender will extend you an offer of credit. You are not yet approved for a loan or a specific rate. All credit decisions, including loan approval, if any, are determined by Lenders, in their sole discretion. Lowest rate advertised is not available for all loan sizes, types, or purposes, and assumes a very well qualified borrower with an excellent credit profile. 2 To check the rates and terms you may prequalify for, Credible conducts a soft credit pull that will not affect your credit score. If you choose a lender and continue with your application, the lender will usually conduct a hard credit pull that may impact your credit score. Debt consolidation and credit card refinancing involve using a new loan to pay off your existing balance. This does not eliminate debt, but replaces one debt with another. While personal loan rates generally are lower than credit card interest rates, you may pay more in origination fees and interest over the life of the loan depending on other loan terms. Please consult a financial advisor to determine if refinancing or consolidating is right for you. 3 SOFI Disclaimers | 4 Lightstream Disclaimers | 5 LendingClub Disclaimers | 6 BHG Disclaimers | View Disclosure 1 Personal Loans Rate and Terms Disclosure: Rates for personal loans provided by lenders on the Credible platform range between 6.99% - 35.99% APR with terms from 12 to 120 months.

Matt Reeves, who serves as executive producer on the series, takes us back to Penguin's appearance in ""The Batman,"" sharing how the character's arc continues from someone who lacked respect in the criminal underworld of Gotham, to the kingpin who eventually runs it. The Studio Wanted 'Joker 2' Immediately. Todd Phillips Explains Why It Took 5 Years After 'Rings Of Power' Revealed The Stranger’s Name In Season 2 And Sauron’s Identity In Season 1, Charlie Vickers Told Me Why Daniel Weyman Was Better At Keeping Secrets Than Him WARNING! We’re talking massive -- and I mean MASSIVE -- spoilers about the ""Rings of Power"" Season 2 finale that just dropped on the 2024 TV schedule. So, if you aren’t caught up, I recommend watching the show with an Amazon Prime subscription before scrolling any further. In Season 1 of ""Rings of Power,"" questions and theories about Sauron's identity were flying around like mad. Then, in the show's first finale, it was revealed that Charlie Vickers’ Halbrand was in fact the infamous ""Lord of the Rings"" villain in disguise. However, there was another mystery floating around those first episodes regarding the name of The Stranger, and it persisted into Season 2. Well, now we know the name of Daniel Weyman’s mysterious wizard, and Vickers, who is also familiar with keeping his character’s name hidden, opened up about that big reveal and how hard it is to those kinds of secrets. Keegan-Michael Key Explains The Origins Of That Hilarious 'Key & Peele' Joke That Ended Up In 'Transformers One' ‘Don’t Get Me Started:’ 'Shrinking’s' Christa Miller Shares The Personal Connection Between Her And Liz’s Love For Rocks Colin Farrell Tells Us The Real Reason Why His Batman Villain Hates The Nickname The Penguin ‘I Want Each Role To Scare Me A Bit’: Ella Purnell Talks About Why She Takes On Such Complex Characters, And Honestly It Makes Me Love Her Roles Even More 'Joker 2' Director Todd Phillips Tells Us Why Refuses To Read Any Of The Online Rumors About His Sequel Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga are two revered actors who, at various times in their careers, have been the subject of controversy and fan speculation. It’s only fitting, then, that ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" be as sensationalized as the actors themselves. Whether it’s Gaga’s official/unofficial hype track (which has now been confirmed with the release of her album ""Harlequin"") or unrevealed details surrounding the film itself, it seems that fans online can’t stop talking about the follow-up to Todd Phillips’ Best Picture-nominated 2019 film. Not that Phillips himself would know, though, as he hasn’t read a word of it. I spoke with Todd Phillips ahead of the upcoming sequel's release, and when I mentioned the internet chatter, he volunteered this information. 'That Ship Has Sailed': Winona Ryder Tells Us The Sequel She Tried For Years To Get Made, And I'm So Sad It Never Happened The hype surrounding the 2024 movie schedule may be rising soon, given that a certain highly anticipate title is about to rear it's humorously creepy head -- Tim Burton’s ""Beetlejuice Beetlejuice."" The long awaited legacy-quel to the 1988 classic, this upcoming horror movie also marks the return of actor Winona Ryder as the iconic Lydia Deetz. And, while speaking with her about this welcomed revisitation, Ryder not only expressed excitement for this project, but revealed to CinemaBlend another legacy-quel she was trying to get off the ground for years. Sadly, in her own words, ""that ship has sailed,"" and it makes me sad. While sitting down with the veteran performer behind films like ""Bram Stoker’s Dracula"" and ""Edward Scissorhands,"" I asked her if there are any other roles from her illustrious career that she'd love to reprise. When faced with that question, Winona Ryder shared this answer with CinemaBlend. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman I.D. Their Real-Life Variants ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" stars Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and director Shawn Levy I.D. their ""real-world variants"" and apparently ruin all of their careers in this hilarious interview.

Readers, Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you — our readers. We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight. Now that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and 
					joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes 
					to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; 
					senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want 
					to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our 
					independence. We don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our 
					hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade. We're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. 
					Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates 
					them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness. One reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of 
					our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness. Help us save her. A second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have 
					trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political 
					spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily 
					Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, 
					Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others. Simply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a 
					fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference. Since 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. 
					And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible 
					to ignore. We can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — 
					the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back. Please consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, 
					corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new 
					generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there 
					are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness. In return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that 
					we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need 
					revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent 
					we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and 
					lightning fast website you deserve. Patriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters 
					and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours. We can save America together. Become a Daily Caller Patriot today. Neil Patel YOU HAVE REACHED PREMIUM CONTENT CONTINUE READING FOR $120 $1 ALSO, ENJOY THE MANY BENEFITS OF PATRIOTS MEMBERSHIP JOIN US!"
