# Automated Website categorization using machine learning algorithms
## Project Overview
This is Group 41's Fall 2024 Break Through Tech AI Studio project hosted by Verizon. It uses machine learning algorithms to predict the category of a website.

The data provided to us is in categorizedurls.csv. It contains 1000 url strings (e.g. "amazon.com") and their corresponding category (e.g. "Shopping"), but is incomplete for a machine learning algorithm. The files in this repository are used to 1) scrape the contents of the websites using Selenium and BeautifulSoup4; 2) process the raw text to add features to the data set; 3) build a pipeline and evaluate the performance.<br />
