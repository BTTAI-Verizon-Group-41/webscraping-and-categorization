# Automated Website categorization using machine learning algorithms
## Project Overview
This is Group 41's Fall 2024 Break Through Tech AI Studio project hosted by Verizon. It uses machine learning algorithms to predict the category of a website.

The data provided to us is in categorizedurls.csv. It contains 1000 URL strings (e.g. "amazon.com") and their corresponding category (e.g. "Shopping"), but is incomplete for a machine learning algorithm. The files in this repository are used to 1) scrape the contents of the websites using Selenium and BeautifulSoup4; 2) process the raw text to add features to the dataset; 3) build a pipeline and evaluate the performance.

The sample complete dataset is full.csv in the folder tia-nltkmodel. 

### Business Impact
The general use of website categorization include helping users to find relevant websites quickly, and delivering better browsing experience with safer access.

More specifically, this project aligns with verizon’s goals of:<br/>
1. Enhancing content filtering and parental controls<br/>
&nbspBy categorizing websites, Verizon can provide more effective content filtering options for families and educational institutions, helping to protect minors from accessing inappropriate or harmful content. Improved parental control options enhance Verizon’s product offerings, making its services more attractive to households with children. This also contributes to Verizon’s brand as a family-friendly internet provider, potentially increasing customer retention.

2. Increasing competitiveness in the telecommunications market<br/>
&nbspIt allows targeted marketing, such that verizon can strengthen partnerships with content providers. It can also potentially enhance service through traffic prioritization, and help verizon in the process of optimizing infrastructure based on categorized usage patterns and ensuring efficient resource allocation.

3. Offering advanced website categorization and filtering features can help Verizon differentiate itself in the competitive telecom market.

## User Guide
For the installation instructions and the step-by-step guide on how to setup the project locally, train the model, and evaluate model performance, see the [User Guide](UserGuide.md).

## Objectives and Goals
We set the goal to achieve an accuracy of at least 60%.

## Potential next steps
1. Higher accuracy
    - Improve data quality by obtaining a larger dataset and/or using more features
    - Hyperparameter tuning and perform grid search
2. Try different types of web categorization models
    - Analyze images and videos on a website
    - Focus on targeting specific websites e.g. phishing detection
